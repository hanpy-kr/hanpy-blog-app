# Kubernetes Introduction

Let's get familiar with the basics of Kubernetes.
The reason for learning Kubernetes is simple: it greatly assists in developing/deploying applications.



Initially, applications had no networking.
Therefore, deploying applications wasn't as straightforward as it is now.
To deploy applications, they were distributed to physical disks and installed locally for data management.
For instance, it's like installing software such as "Word/Excel" on a computer for usage.



With the popularization of networking, the era of physical servers arrived.
In a corporate context, it involves installing company applications on servers located in server rooms and integrating them into the network.
While this seems like a common approach, there are drawbacks.
Primarily, to install servers, you need to buy them.
Moreover, it takes several months for expensive servers to be delivered. Additionally,
if you want to expand the servers you've bought, you'll need to purchase and wait for the delivery of more servers.
Nevertheless, during that time, this method was the best available.



The emergence of AWS, which most people are familiar with, allows for large-scale public clouds.
This concept involves virtualizing hardware,
meaning resources (CPU/RAM) can be dynamically allocated, allowing for server usage.
This drastically reduces the time it takes to increase server capacity,
from a process that took months in the era of physical servers to simply clicking a mouse button to buy cloud servers or expand existing ones.



With these changes in the infrastructure environment,
virtualization processing at the operating system level also becomes possible.
And Kubernetes is what makes this possible.

## Word



#### Application

A computer program created by developers for a specific purpose.



#### Steps to create an application

1. Development: Developers write source code to make the application function.
2. Build: Optimizes the written source code to transform it into an executable form.
3. Deployment: Moves the application to an executable environment (AWS).
4. Execution: Initiates the deployed application.



#### Application environments

- Development environment: Environment where source code is written and executable files are created after building.
- Execution environment: Environment where the executable files are run from development. This includes virtual machines, cloud environments, including the operating system.
